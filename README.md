# GPIO-web-server-RPI
A gpio web server using python and flask that i made


To set this up, put this all in the same directory, and change IP in app.py to your IP with the following format: http://0.0.0.0 where 0.0.0.0 is your ip address.

If this is a headless display, you need to run it on boot.
use the webserver.service (assuming you are in /home/pi) and set it up to do this.

My code is kinda bad, so dont expect wonders. I made this in a day to controll a moon.

If you are willing, clean up the code and reupload it.
